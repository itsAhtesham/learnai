                Snieh Masi (Cow skin) may be acquired from a range of sources; craftspeople
                in Larnai obtain the skin from both Jowai and Shillong markets. Cow skin is
                being used as a platform because it can withstand the pressure of the syndrai
                (Dumbbell-shaped wooden log) while pounding clay. Because clay does not
                adhere to leather tats, they prefer cow skin as a base, which is also easily
                available in the marketplace. Any other material, such as fabric or plastic,
                cannot be used as a substitute since a robust material is required.

                Clay is drained from the Sung Valley River. Sung Valley is located in
                Meghalaya, between the West Jaintia Hills and the East Khasi Hills Districts.
                Artists employ 5-6 workers for a week, then the same individuals dig for a week
                in Sung Valley just because it takes this long time to fill a pickup truck. When
                the water level drops in February and March, it becomes easier to get clay out;
                otherwise, 10-20 feet of excavation may be required.
            </p>

                Syndrai (Dumbbell-shaped wooden log), Pine wood is used to build Syndrai.
                For Larnai's craftspeople, the jowai market is the only place where they can
                easily obtain premade Syndrai. Syndrai is used for pounding the clay.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Water is an essential element used to moisten the clay because if the soil is not
                kept wet, it will dry up and become hard to use.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                A wooden plank provides a base for the clay, which can be placed and sculpted.
                Wooden planks are purchased from the market by artisans. The dimension of
                30wooden planks is cut up to 8*8 - 10*20 inches, and there is no such thing as a
                standard plank size.
            </p>

                Saingada (A half-rounded wooden bat) is used to flatten the bottom of the
                pottery. Saingadas are purchased from the market by artisans.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The stone is used to smoothen the pottery's surface. There is no special stone to
                use; any smooth textured stone will suffice. A seed called nub can also be used
                as a substitute for the stone used by artists.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The thread is used to remove the pottery from the plank. Any kind of thin
                thread can be used, sometimes artisans also use metallic wire as an alternative
                to thread.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The furnace consists of a metal body and a big cylindrical and cuboid-shaped
                container with several rods within, under which coal and woods are ignited and
                baked by placing the pottery on top of the rods.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In the furnace, artists utilise stone coal because it burns for a long time,
                produces enough heat, and is inexpensive.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Artists put wood also in the furnace because it helps coal to burn properly and
                quickly.
