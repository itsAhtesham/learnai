                The simple method of moulding clay in India evolved over time. This simple style
                spawned a slew of different looks. Unglazed clay, glazed pottery, terracotta, and
                papier-mache are some of the most common types of pottery.

                <h3>Unglazed Pottery</h3>
                
                Unglazed pottery, India's oldest form of pottery, is divided into three varieties. The
                first type is paper-thin pottery, which is biscuit-colored and has etched patterns. The
                sgraffito technique involves polishing the matka pot and painting it with red and
                white slips in elaborate designs. The third form of pottery is polished pottery, which is
                robust and highly engraved with stylized arabesque patterns.

                <h3>Glazed Pottery</h3>
                During the Neolithic period, early glazed ceramics were employed to make beads,
                seals, and bangles, but these glazes were rarely utilised in pottery. The most prevalent
                colors for these glazed beads and bangles are light blue and green, but white, red, dark
                blue, and black glazed beads have also been seen. Glazed pottery became more
                prominent in the 12th century AD. A white backdrop with blue and green motifs is
                common in this type of ceramic. Glazed pottery is only used in a few places around the
                country.

                <h3>Terracotta sculpture</h3>
                Terracotta is the name given to unglazed earthenware and ceramic sculpture created
                with it. From a very early date, Indian sculpture made extensive use of terracotta
                (with stone and metal sculpture being relatively rare), and by the 1st century BC, more
                advanced places had entirely abandoned modelling in favor of employing moulds.
                23This enables the creation of huge figures, virtually life-size, notably during the Gupta
                period (319-543 CE) and the centuries that followed.
                Several vibrant local popular terracotta folk sculpture traditions, such as the Bankura
                horses, are still active today. During festivals, women frequently make clay sculptures
                to appease their gods and goddesses. Deities in Moela are made out of moulded clay
                on a level surface. After that, they're burned and painted in vibrant colors.
